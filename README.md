# Submarine Cable Global Deployment Dashboard

## 🏗️ Project Context  
- Dashboard built during my time working as a business analyst at CNT, Ecuador. 

⚠️ Note: This repository does not contain any sensitive information from CNT. The dashboard was developed using publicly available data from the TeleGeography website (2018).

## 📌 Project Overview  

This dashboard was developed with the objective of providing a **benchmarking** tool for evaluating potential alternatives in the future deployment of a submarine cable in Ecuador.

It integrates multiple tables—covering regions, landing stations, and suppliers—and consolidates a wide range of information, including cost data. Custom measures were created to calculate **KPIs** such as cost per km. The analysis revealed an average cost of USD 42.75 thousand per km across 57 submarine cables built in the region, totaling approximately 248,000 km.
