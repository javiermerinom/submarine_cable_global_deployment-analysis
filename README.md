# Submarine Cable Global Deployment Dashboard

## 🏗️ Project Context  
- Dashboard built during my time working as a business analyst at CNT, Ecuador.

## 📌 Project Overview  

This dashboard was developed using data gathered from the **TeleGeography** website in 2018, with the objective of providing a **benchmarking** tool for evaluating potential alternatives in the future deployment of a submarine cable in Ecuador.

It integrates multiple tables—covering regions, landing stations, and suppliers—and consolidates a wide range of information, including cost data. Custom measures were created to calculate **KPIs** such as cost per kilometer and total kilometers built. The analysis revealed an average cost of USD 42.75 thousand per km across 57 submarine cables built in the region, for an approximate of 248,000 kilometers deployment.
